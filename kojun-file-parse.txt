Understanding the Kojun Puzzle Matrices

The matrices in your data describe a Kojun puzzle, which is a logic puzzle created by Otto Janko. Let me explain how these matrices define the puzzle:
What is a Kojun Puzzle?

Kojun (also known as Ripple Effect) is a logic puzzle played on a grid divided into regions. The rules are:

    Each region must contain consecutive numbers starting from 1
    The same number cannot appear in adjacent cells (including diagonally)
    Numbers in the same row or column must be different

The Matrices in Your Data
1. [problem] Matrix

This represents the initial state of the puzzle with given numbers:

    Numbers 1-7 are the initial clues
    Dashes ("-") represent empty cells to be filled

2. [areas] Matrix

This defines the regions of the puzzle:

    Each number represents a region ID
    Cells with the same number belong to the same region
    There are 63 distinct regions in this puzzle

3. [solution] Matrix

This contains the complete solution to the puzzle with all cells filled correctly.
4. [moves] Matrix

This records the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle, using coordinate notation.
